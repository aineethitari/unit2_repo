# Unit 1 Reflection\

## What worked well during unit 1
I learned the python functions and used them in the tasks and project. I feel like unit 1 was a good start to computer science as we learned the basics and try to implement them as much as possible.
I did the flowcharts quite nicely, and were able to finish all the assignments. 

## What did not work well
At the beginning, some of the quizzes were challenging, so I sometimes feel lost in class or when I try to finish them at home.
Time management was quite tough as there were many assignments that should not take too long, but I spend too much time on them.

## What did you enjoyed the most during project unit 1?
I enjoyed doing the project the most because it was the first thing I actually created and designed. When the wallet actually work, I feel extremely accomplished. It really boosted my confidence in doing computer science. 

## What talent have you discovered or practiced during this unit?
I discovered that I have a talent in creating flowcharts because unlike most of my classmates, I find creating flowcharts fun and I did them quite nicely.
I also learned that if I work hard, I would be able to do anything no matter how hard it is. I discovered that I am the type of person to try until I succeed, which I am very glad to have that trait.

## What is working well in Computer Science for you?
I think that computer science in general is going very well. At the beginning, I thought that I would not enjoy it because it is so challenging. However, when I get the hang of it, I feel very confident. 
I think my organization skills are very nice because when it is the due date, I only need to edit a few things and submit it. 

## What can Dr Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?
I would like to continue meeting in individual meetings as they are extremely helpful. I also would like to learn more about what will be on the IB exams.
